# portkey_mcp_integration_capabilities (Resource)

Manages capability overrides for a Portkey MCP integration.

Capabilities represent the tools, resources, and prompts exposed by an MCP server. This resource manages which capabilities are enabled or disabled at the integration level. Only capabilities listed in the configuration will be managed; others retain their defaults.

~> **Note:** Deleting this resource does not remove capabilities from the MCP integration. Instead, it resets all managed capabilities to their default state (enabled).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "portkey_mcp_integration" "github" {
  name      = "GitHub MCP Server"
  url       = "https://mcp.github.com/sse"
  auth_type = "headers"
  transport = "sse"
}

resource "portkey_mcp_integration_capabilities" "github" {
  mcp_integration_id = portkey_mcp_integration.github.id

  capabilities = [
    {
      name    = "create_pull_request"
      type    = "tool"
      enabled = true
    },
    {
      name    = "delete_repository"
      type    = "tool"
      enabled = false # Disable dangerous tool at org level
    },
  ]
}
```
